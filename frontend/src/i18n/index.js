        "infrastructure_title": "Using Open Infrastructure",
        "infrastructure_text": "The Africa PID Alliance is working to fulfil the continent's need for academic data infrastructures. Africa's diverse economic development is reflected in the continent's fast-growing requirement for strong scholarly data infrastructures. Many universities are unable to provide Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for all scholarly outputs, even though some can afford them for their research. Grey literature still contains a large amount of research conducted in Africa. The Africa PID Alliance recognises this gap and seeks to focus on protecting and advancing indigenous knowledge, cultural heritage, and patent digital object containers.",

This method connects DOIs produced by the DOI Foundation (prefix 10) with locally generated handles (prefix 20). A digital object identifier container will combine DOIs with locally generated handle IDs for patents, offering a thorough overview of the research process, the inventions that result in patents, and associated publications, papers, and media.",
        "approach_text_2": "By combining scientific data and biocultural characteristics into a single digital object container, this novel multilinear data model also applies to indigenous knowledge. It successfully connects different kinds of digital items. Ceremonies, for example, incorporate various forms of cultural heritage, including dance, singing, textile art, and associated research, all of which require digital identification and preservation.",

        "diffusion_innovation_text_1": "While the digital transformation of cultural heritage and research infrastructures has opened up new avenues, it has also given rise to ethical concerns, particularly with regard to Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS). African cultural artefacts and knowledge are often scattered across fragmented digital silos with limited interoperability and provenance transparency. This refined and contextually aligned description explains the need for integrating Digital Object Container Identifier (DOCiD) as a use case for universities and Indigenous and cultural heritage institutions, grounded in FAIR and CARE principles and emphasizing interoperability.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_2": "Integrating DOCiD as a use case within universities and Indigenous and cultural heritage institutions addresses the urgent need for structured, ethical, and interoperable management of digital knowledge assets. As institutions increasingly digitise research outputs, oral traditions, and cultural materials, there is a critical gap in systems that can ensure both technical discoverability and community sovereignty over data.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_3": "Positioning DOCiD as a site for the diffusion of innovation establishes it as a living laboratory where open science practices meet indigenous data governance. This process fosters co-creation between academia, communities, and technology developers, demonstrating how emerging digital infrastructures can evolve responsibly to accommodate plural knowledge systems. Through this integration, DOCiD becomes not just a technological solution but an innovation-in-the-making—a catalyst for redefining interoperability, inclusivity, and equity in the digital knowledge economy.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_4": "DOCiD provides a persistent, metadata-rich identifier framework that connects digital objects—such as datasets, recordings, artefacts, and publications—to their contextual relationships and provenance. This enables alignment with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), ensuring that institutional knowledge is globally visible and reusable through interoperable metadata standards.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_5": "Librarians and curators play a pivotal role in this process—as stewards of metadata quality, provenance, and ethical data governance. Their involvement ensures that DOCiD implementation aligns with institutional data management policies, supports community consent, and embeds traditional knowledge labels or protocols where appropriate. By involving these professionals, institutions can foster a responsible and inclusive data ecosystem that balances openness with cultural sensitivity and ownership.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_6": "At the same time, DOCiD integrates the CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), embedding mechanisms for ethical stewardship, attribution, and community governance of Indigenous and cultural heritage data. By doing so, it balances the openness encouraged by FAIR with the protections and respect required by CARE.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_7": "For universities, DOCiD supports transparent research management, metadata harmonization, and open science infrastructures. For Indigenous and cultural heritage institutions, it safeguards traditional knowledge through controlled sharing frameworks, acknowledging cultural protocols while enabling participation in global knowledge ecosystems.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_8": "Through interoperability with existing PID infrastructures (e.g., CSTR, ISNI, ORCID, RAiD, ROR, DOI, ARK, Handle), DOCiD ensures that African and Indigenous knowledge systems are digitally represented, contextually linked, and ethically governed—contributing to a more inclusive and equitable global research and data landscape.",
        "collaboration_title": "Collaboration",

Cette méthode connecte les DOI produits par la Fondation DOI (préfixe 10) avec des handles générés localement (préfixe 20). Un conteneur d'identifiant d'objet numérique combinera les DOI avec des identifiants de handle générés localement pour les brevets, offrant un aperçu complet du processus de recherche, des inventions qui aboutissent à des brevets, et des publications, articles et médias associés.",
        "approach_text_2": "En combinant les données scientifiques et les caractéristiques bioculturelles dans un seul conteneur d'objet numérique, ce nouveau modèle de données multilinéaire s'applique également aux connaissances autochtones. Il connecte avec succès différents types d'éléments numériques. Les cérémonies, par exemple, incorporent diverses formes de patrimoine culturel, y compris la danse, le chant, l'art textile et la recherche associée, qui nécessitent toutes une identification et une préservation numériques.",

Les artefacts culturels et les connaissances africains sont souvent dispersés dans des silos numériques fragmentés avec une interopérabilité et une transparence de provenance limitées. Cette description raffinée et contextuellement alignée explique la nécessité d'intégrer le Digital Object Container Identifier (DOCiD) comme cas d'usage pour les universités et les institutions de patrimoine culturel autochtone, fondé sur les principes FAIR et CARE et mettant l'accent sur l'interopérabilité.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_2": "L'intégration de DOCiD comme cas d'usage au sein des universités et des institutions de patrimoine culturel autochtone répond au besoin urgent d'une gestion structurée, éthique et interopérable des actifs de connaissances numériques. Alors que les institutions numérisent de plus en plus les résultats de recherche, les traditions orales et les matériaux culturels, il existe un écart critique dans les systèmes qui peuvent assurer à la fois la découvrabilité technique et la souveraineté communautaire sur les données.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_3": "Positionner DOCiD comme site de diffusion de l'innovation l'établit comme un laboratoire vivant où les pratiques de science ouverte rencontrent la gouvernance des données autochtones. Ce processus favorise la co-création entre le monde académique, les communautés et les développeurs de technologies, démontrant comment les infrastructures numériques émergentes peuvent évoluer de manière responsable pour s'adapter aux systèmes de connaissances pluriels. Grâce à cette intégration, DOCiD devient non seulement une solution technologique mais une innovation en devenir—un catalyseur pour redéfinir l'interopérabilité, l'inclusivité et l'équité dans l'économie de la connaissance numérique.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_4": "DOCiD fournit un cadre d'identification persistant et riche en métadonnées qui connecte les objets numériques—tels que les jeux de données, les enregistrements, les artefacts et les publications—à leurs relations contextuelles et leur provenance. Cela permet l'alignement avec les principes FAIR (Trouvable, Accessible, Interopérable, Réutilisable), garantissant que les connaissances institutionnelles sont globalement visibles et réutilisables grâce à des normes de métadonnées interopérables.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_5": "Les bibliothécaires et conservateurs jouent un rôle essentiel dans ce processus—en tant que gardiens de la qualité des métadonnées, de la provenance et de la gouvernance éthique des données. Leur implication garantit que la mise en œuvre de DOCiD s'aligne sur les politiques de gestion des données institutionnelles, soutient le consentement communautaire et intègre des étiquettes ou protocoles de connaissances traditionnelles le cas échéant. En impliquant ces professionnels, les institutions peuvent favoriser un écosystème de données responsable et inclusif qui équilibre l'ouverture avec la sensibilité culturelle et la propriété.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_6": "Dans le même temps, DOCiD intègre les principes CARE (Bénéfice Collectif, Autorité de Contrôle, Responsabilité et Éthique), incorporant des mécanismes d'intendance éthique, d'attribution et de gouvernance communautaire des données du patrimoine culturel autochtone. Ce faisant, il équilibre l'ouverture encouragée par FAIR avec les protections et le respect requis par CARE.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_7": "Pour les universités, DOCiD soutient la gestion transparente de la recherche, l'harmonisation des métadonnées et les infrastructures de science ouverte.

        "diffusion_innovation_text_2": "Kuunganisha DOCiD kama matumizi ndani ya vyuo vikuu na taasisi za urithi wa kitamaduni wa asili kunashughulikia hitaji la haraka la usimamizi wa kimkakati, wa kimaadili na wa kushirikiana wa mali za maarifa ya kidijitali. Kadiri taasisi zinavyoongeza kwa kasi matokeo ya utafiti, desturi za mdomo, na nyenzo za kitamaduni, kuna pengo muhimu katika mifumo inayoweza kuhakikisha ugunduzi wa kiufundi na uhuru wa jamii juu ya data.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_3": "Kuweka DOCiD kama eneo la usambazaji wa ubunifu linalianzisha kama maabara hai ambapo mazoezi ya sayansi wazi yanakutana na utawala wa data za asili. Mchakato huu unakuza uundaji wa pamoja kati ya kitaaluma, jamii, na waendelezaji wa teknolojia, ukionyesha jinsi miundombinu ya kidijitali inayoibuka inaweza kubadilika kwa uwajibikaji ili kukidhi mifumo mingi ya maarifa. Kupitia muunganisho huu, DOCiD inakuwa sio tu suluhisho la kiteknolojia bali ubunifu unaoundwa—chomeo cha kufafanua upya ushirikiano, ujumuishaji, na usawa katika uchumi wa maarifa ya kidijitali.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_4": "DOCiD inatoa mfumo wa kitambulisho thabiti na tajiri wa metadata unaoaunganisha vitu vya kidijitali—kama vile seti za data, rekodi, vitu vya sanaa, na machapisho—na mahusiano yao ya muktadha na asili. Hii inaruhusu muunganisho na kanuni za FAIR (Inayopatikana, Inayofikiwa, Inayoshirikiana, Inayoweza Kutumika Tena), ikihakikisha kwamba maarifa ya kitaasisi yanaonekana kimataifa na yanaweza kutumika tena kupitia viwango vya metadata vinavyoshirikiana.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_5": "Waanadamu wa maktaba na wakurugenzi wana jukumu muhimu katika mchakato huu—kama walezi wa ubora wa metadata, asili, na utawala wa data wa kimaadili. Ushiriki wao unahakikisha kwamba utekelezaji wa DOCiD unalingana na sera za usimamizi wa data za kitaasisi, unaunga mkono idhini ya jamii, na kuweka lebo au itifaki za maarifa ya jadi pale inapofaa. Kwa kujumuisha wataalamu hawa, taasisi zinaweza kukuza mfumo wa data wenye uwajibikaji na ujumuishaji unaolinganisha uwazi na unyeti wa kitamaduni na umiliki.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_6": "Wakati huo huo, DOCiD inaunganisha kanuni za CARE (Faida ya Pamoja, Mamlaka ya Kudhibiti, Uwajibikaji, na Maadili), ikiweka ndani miundo ya ulinzi wa kimaadili, utambuzi, na utawala wa jamii wa data za urithi wa kitamaduni wa asili. Kwa kufanya hivyo, inalinganisha uwazi unaohamasishwa na FAIR na ulinzi na heshima inayohitajika na CARE.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_7": "Kwa vyuo vikuu, DOCiD inaunga mkono usimamizi wa uwazi wa utafiti, upatanisho wa metadata, na miundombinu ya sayansi wazi. Kwa taasisi za urithi wa kitamaduni wa asili, inalinda maarifa ya jadi kupitia mifumo ya kushiriki iliyodhibitiwa, ikitambua itifaki za kitamaduni huku ikiruhusu ushiriki katika mifumo ya maarifa ya kimataifa.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_8": "Kupitia ushirikiano na miundombinu ya PID iliyopo (k.m., CSTR, ISNI, ORCID, RAiD, ROR, DOI, ARK, Handle), DOCiD inahakikisha kwamba mifumo ya maarifa ya Kiafrika na ya asili inawakilishwa kwa njia ya kidijitali, imeunganishwa kwa muktadha na inadhibitiwa kwa kimaadili—ikichangia mandhari ya utafiti na data ya kimataifa iliyojumuisha zaidi na ya usawa.",

        "diffusion_innovation_text_2": "إن دمج DOCiD كحالة استخدام داخل الجامعات ومؤسسات التراث الثقافي الأصلي يعالج الحاجة الملحة للإدارة المنظمة والأخلاقية والقابلة للتشغيل البيني لأصول المعرفة الرقمية. مع قيام المؤسسات برقمنة مخرجات البحث والتقاليد الشفوية والمواد الثقافية بشكل متزايد، هناك فجوة حرجة في الأنظمة التي يمكن أن تضمن كلاً من قابلية الاكتشاف التقني والسيادة المجتمعية على البيانات.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_3": "إن وضع DOCiD كموقع لنشر الابتكار يجعله مختبراً حياً حيث تلتقي ممارسات العلم المفتوح بحوكمة البيانات الأصلية. تعزز هذه العملية الإنشاء المشترك بين الأوساط الأكاديمية والمجتمعات ومطوري التكنولوجيا، مما يوضح كيف يمكن للبنى التحتية الرقمية الناشئة أن تتطور بمسؤولية لاستيعاب أنظمة المعرفة المتعددة. من خلال هذا التكامل، لا يصبح DOCiD مجرد حل تكنولوجي بل ابتكاراً قيد التطوير—حافزاً لإعادة تعريف قابلية التشغيل البيني والشمولية والمساواة في اقتصاد المعرفة الرقمية.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_4": "يوفر DOCiD إطار معرّف دائم وغني بالبيانات الوصفية يربط الكائنات الرقمية—مثل مجموعات البيانات والتسجيلات والقطع الأثرية والمنشورات—بعلاقاتها السياقية ومصدرها. يتيح ذلك التوافق مع مبادئ FAIR (قابل للعثور، قابل للوصول، قابل للتشغيل البيني، قابل لإعادة الاستخدام)، مما يضمن أن المعرفة المؤسسية مرئية عالمياً وقابلة لإعادة الاستخدام من خلال معايير البيانات الوصفية القابلة للتشغيل البيني.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_5": "يلعب أمناء المكتبات والقيمون دوراً محورياً في هذه العملية—كأوصياء على جودة البيانات الوصفية والمصدر وحوكمة البيانات الأخلاقية. يضمن مشاركتهم أن تنفيذ DOCiD يتماشى مع سياسات إدارة البيانات المؤسسية، ويدعم موافقة المجتمع، ويدمج تسميات أو بروتوكولات المعرفة التقليدية حيثما كان ذلك مناسباً. من خلال إشراك هؤلاء المهنيين، يمكن للمؤسسات تعزيز نظام بيانات مسؤول وشامل يوازن بين الانفتاح والحساسية الثقافية والملكية.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_6": "في الوقت نفسه، يدمج DOCiD مبادئ CARE (المنفعة الجماعية، سلطة التحكم، المسؤولية، والأخلاقيات)، مع تضمين آليات للإشراف الأخلاقي والإسناد والحوكمة المجتمعية لبيانات التراث الثقافي الأصلي. من خلال القيام بذلك، يوازن بين الانفتاح الذي تشجعه FAIR والحماية والاحترام المطلوبين من CARE.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_7": "بالنسبة للجامعات، يدعم DOCiD الإدارة الشفافة للبحث وتنسيق البيانات الوصفية والبنى التحتية للعلوم المفتوحة. بالنسبة لمؤسسات التراث الثقافي الأصلي، فإنه يحمي المعرفة التقليدية من خلال أطر المشاركة المتحكم فيها، مع الاعتراف بالبروتوكولات الثقافية مع تمكين المشاركة في النظم البيئية للمعرفة العالمية.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_8": "من خلال قابلية التشغيل البيني مع البنى التحتية الموجودة لـ PID (مثل CSTR و ISNI و ORCID و RAiD و ROR و DOI و ARK و Handle)، يضمن DOCiD أن أنظمة المعرفة الأفريقية والأصلية ممثلة رقمياً ومرتبطة سياقياً ومحكومة أخلاقياً—مما يساهم في مشهد بحثي وبيانات عالمي أكثر شمولاً وإنصافاً.",

Artefatos culturais e conhecimentos africanos são frequentemente dispersos em silos digitais fragmentados com interoperabilidade limitada e transparência de proveniência. Esta descrição refinada e contextualmente alinhada explica a necessidade de integrar o Identificador de Contêiner de Objeto Digital (DOCiD) como um caso de uso para universidades e instituições de patrimônio cultural indígena, fundamentado nos princípios FAIR e CARE e enfatizando a interoperabilidade.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_2": "Integrar o DOCiD como caso de uso dentro de universidades e instituições de patrimônio cultural indígena aborda a necessidade urgente de gestão estruturada, ética e interoperável de ativos de conhecimento digital. À medida que as instituições digitalizam cada vez mais resultados de pesquisa, tradições orais e materiais culturais, existe uma lacuna crítica em sistemas que possam garantir tanto a descoberta técnica quanto a soberania comunitária sobre os dados.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_3": "Posicionar o DOCiD como um local para a difusão da inovação o estabelece como um laboratório vivo onde as práticas de ciência aberta encontram a governança de dados indígenas. Este processo promove a cocriação entre academia, comunidades e desenvolvedores de tecnologia, demonstrando como as infraestruturas digitais emergentes podem evoluir de forma responsável para acomodar sistemas de conhecimento plurais. Através desta integração, o DOCiD torna-se não apenas uma solução tecnológica, mas uma inovação em formação—um catalisador para redefinir interoperabilidade, inclusão e equidade na economia do conhecimento digital.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_4": "O DOCiD fornece uma estrutura de identificador persistente e rica em metadados que conecta objetos digitais—como conjuntos de dados, gravações, artefatos e publicações—às suas relações contextuais e proveniência.

Seu envolvimento garante que a implementação do DOCiD se alinhe com as políticas institucionais de gestão de dados, apoie o consentimento comunitário e incorpore rótulos ou protocolos de conhecimento tradicional quando apropriado. Ao envolver esses profissionais, as instituições podem fomentar um ecossistema de dados responsável e inclusivo que equilibra abertura com sensibilidade cultural e propriedade.",

Ein digitaler Objekt-Identifikator-Container wird DOIs mit lokal generierten Handle-IDs für Patente kombinieren und einen umfassenden Überblick über den Forschungsprozess, die Erfindungen, die zu Patenten führen, und zugehörige Publikationen, Artikel und Medien bieten.",

Diese verfeinerte und kontextuell ausgerichtete Beschreibung erklärt die Notwendigkeit der Integration des Digital Object Container Identifier (DOCiD) als Anwendungsfall für Universitäten und indigene sowie kulturelle Erbe-Institutionen, basierend auf FAIR- und CARE-Prinzipien und mit Schwerpunkt auf Interoperabilität.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_2": "Die Integration von DOCiD als Anwendungsfall in Universitäten und indigenen sowie kulturellen Erbe-Institutionen adressiert den dringenden Bedarf an strukturiertem, ethischem und interoperablem Management digitaler Wissensbestände. Da Institutionen zunehmend Forschungsergebnisse, mündliche Überlieferungen und kulturelle Materialien digitalisieren, besteht eine kritische Lücke in Systemen, die sowohl technische Auffindbarkeit als auch gemeinschaftliche Datensouveränität gewährleisten können.",

Dieser Prozess fördert die Ko-Kreation zwischen Wissenschaft, Gemeinschaften und Technologieentwicklern und demonstriert, wie sich aufkommende digitale Infrastrukturen verantwortungsvoll weiterentwickeln können, um plurale Wissenssysteme zu berücksichtigen. Durch diese Integration wird DOCiD nicht nur zu einer technologischen Lösung, sondern zu einer Innovation im Entstehen—einem Katalysator für die Neudefinition von Interoperabilität, Inklusivität und Gerechtigkeit in der digitalen Wissensökonomie.",
        "diffusion_innovation_text_4": "DOCiD bietet ein persistentes, metadatenreiches Identifikations-Framework, das digitale Objekte—wie Datensätze, Aufzeichnungen, Artefakte und Publikationen—mit ihren kontextuellen Beziehungen und ihrer Herkunft verbindet.

CSTR, ISNI, ORCID, RAiD, ROR, DOI, ARK, Handle) stellt DOCiD sicher, dass afrikanische und indigene Wissenssysteme digital repräsentiert, kontextuell verknüpft und ethisch verwaltet werden—und trägt zu einer inklusiveren und gerechteren globalen Forschungs- und Datenlandschaft bei.",
